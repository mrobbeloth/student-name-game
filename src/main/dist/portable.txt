This file indicates portable mode.
When present, the application stores all data in the application directory
instead of the user's home directory (~/.namegame).

Data files stored locally when in portable mode:
- config.ini - Application settings
- mappings.json - Manual name-to-image mappings
- statistics.json - Game statistics and progress

This allows the application to be run from a USB drive or shared folder
without leaving traces on the host system.
